# Talkify
Talkify is an interactive speech-to-speech application that allows users to speak into their microphone and receive AI-generated responses. The app uses advanced AI models to process and generate natural language responses, leveraging Whisper for speech-to-text, Groq for text-based AI generation, and gTTS for text-to-speech synthesis.
